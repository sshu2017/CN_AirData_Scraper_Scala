# CN AirData Scraper Scala
Scrap China air quality data in Scala

# My first Scala Script on Github!

* It goes to http://pm25.in/ and scape all the air quality data for each city, and save it to a file called **data.txt**.
* Since the http://pm25.in/ updates the data on a hourly basis, running this script once means taking a snapshot.
* So if you need date more than a 'snapshot', you will need to run this script every 60 min.
